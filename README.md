> **Diddi and Eli: a platformer game with scaling challenges.**

## How to play

Using Python `>=3.7` and [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) at a
[recommended version](./requirements.txt), clone or download this

## Credits

This game is a successor to one of my previous titles,
["Abandon the ship!"](https://github.com/DiddiLeija/abandon-the-ship), which was
based on a platformer example bundled within the [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel)
project.

Thanks to all those who contributed with feedback when I was developing the game.
