> **Diddi and Eli: a platformer game with scaling challenges.**

## Storyline

> Diddi and Eli are warriors serving Lady Alix. The Scaler, a powerful
> lord of darkness, is menacing Lady Alix' domains, so she needs Diddi
> and Eli to find the Scaler before he invades the land!

To win, you have to clear five courses, each one harder than the previous.
Once you reach the final course, defeat the evil **Scaler** to win!

You can either play as Diddi (player 1), Ei (player 2) or use a local
co-op mode (2 players using the same device, Diddi & Eli).

## Credits

This game is a successor to my one-shot previous title,
["Abandon the ship!"](https://github.com/DiddiLeija/abandon-the-ship), which was loosely
based on a platformer example bundled within the [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel)
project.

Thanks to all those who contributed with feedback when I was developing the game!
